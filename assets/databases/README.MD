This databased is a parsed and "cleaned" version of the USDA SR food database.
I made a local AI (Gemma 2 9B instruct) to generate a "human readable" name for each food item.
The problem is implementing a reliable search function.
I tried doing something inside useLocalFood.ts, but I didn't like the results.
I'll stick with the USDA apis for now.
